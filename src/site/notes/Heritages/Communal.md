# Communal
**Better Helper:** When using the Help action, instead of providing the normal +2 bonus you grant advantage on the check. You can only give advantage once per short rest in this way or you can spend 1 RP to use it again.
**Communal:** You gain Culture as a Trained Skill. If you already have Culture as a Trained Skill you instead gain a +2 Heritage bonus to Culture checks.
Additionally you gain a +2 Heritage bonus to Diplomacy checks.
