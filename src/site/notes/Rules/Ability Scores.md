# Ability Scores
## Determining Ability Scores
There are many ways to determine Ability Scores. I will list a couple of examples here that are in line with what the ruleset would expect a character to have. You can choose one of them, another one you know or come up with something else. At the end however you should ideally have 6 values between 1 and 18.

### Method 1: Rolling Ability Scores
Rolling dice is fun, so we'll start with this. Obviously the main appeal and also downside of rolling dice is that the range of scores you get can vary drastically. First let's talk about the version I recommend using.
Roll ==6 3d6r1== (Three six-sided dice, re-roll any ones, repeat six times). This will give you 6 values that you can now distribute among the Scores to your liking.

#### Option 1: Different Dice Formulas
Rolling ==6 3d6r1== gives you relatively balanced values, you can't go below 6 and on average you will meet the rulesets expected values. However, you might want to use a different dice formula. Keep in mind that Ability Scores are the primary values of your character. They modify pretty much everything you character does in one way or another so keeping them relatively in line with the rulesets expectations should be a desirable goal. I'll list some options and how they compare to the recommended formula:
- ==6 4d6k3== (Four six-sided dice, keep the highest 3, repeat 6 times) is a classic. It will give you stats that are on average slightly higher than ==6 3d6r1== but you can also get scores lower than 6.
- ==6 3d6== (Thee six-sided dice, repeat six times). This method does not give you any advantage on probability. You just roll and are stuck with what you get. You should expect lower results on average.
- ==6 1d20== (One twenty-sided die, repeat six times). This one is for the very bold. Will also result in lower values on average.

#### Option 2: Rolling Ability Scores in Order
This option changes how you assign the values to the Scores. The overall power level stays the same, but you loose all control over what your characters good Scores are. I recommend to use this option when you don't really know what to do with your character yet and still want to decide, you might even get some inspiration by using this method for your characters strengths and weaknesses.
What you do is similar to not using this option but instead of rolling all values first and then determining which Ability Score to assign each value you roll for Strength first, then Dexterity, then Constitution, then Intelligence, then Wisdom and Charisma last. You can change the order of course, the key change is that you pick the Ability Score to assign to before you know the value.

#### Option 3: The Party Approach
This one is a little more complicated but it's a great option for making characters together in a session 0.
You get a little higher stats as a result of using this option.
What you want to do is make a table like the one below with 6 rows and 6 columns. Also pick a dice formula you want to go with, I'd actually recommend using ==6 3d6== here, since you do get a little higher values on average at the end. Now each player rolls for stats like usual and enters the values in one diagonal of the table like shown below. The GM should fill all the remaining spaces by rolling themselves. This is a little tricky to do with more than 6 players.
Once the table has been filled, each player picks a row and column for their Ability Scores. You can go left to right, right to left, top to bottom and bottom to top but no matter which row, column and direction you choose you have to take the values in order. Each combination can be picked only once by a player.
| Scores | →                |                  |                  |                  |                  | ←                |
| ------ | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| ↓      | Player 1, Roll 1 | Player 2, Roll 1 | Player 3, Roll 1 | Player 4, Roll 1 | Player 5, Roll 1 | Player 6, Roll 1 |
|        | Player 6, Roll 2 | Player 1, Roll 2 | Player 2, Roll 2 | Player 3, Roll 2 | Player 4, Roll 2 | Player 5, Roll 2 |
|        | Player 5, Roll 3 | Player 6, Roll 3 | Player 1, Roll 3 | Player 2, Roll 3 | Player 3, Roll 3 | Player 4, Roll 3 |
|        | Player 4, Roll 4 | Player 5, Roll 4 | Player 6, Roll 4 | Player 1, Roll 4 | Player 2, Roll 4 | Player 3, Roll 4 |
|        | Player 3, Roll 5 | Player 4, Roll 5 | Player 5, Roll 5 | Player 6, Roll 5 | Player 1, Roll 5 | Player 2, Roll 5 |
| ↑      | Player 2, Roll 6 | Player 3, Roll 6 | Player 4, Roll 6 | Player 5, Roll 6 | Player 6, Roll 6 | Player 1, Roll 6 |

### Method 2: Point Buy
Compared to rolling Ability Scores this method gives you more control over how your stats look at the end. You start with a value of 6 in every Score and then you get 36 points to distribute among them on a 1 to1 basis to get your final Scores. Remember that no Score can be above 18.
The values here are made to be in line with the average values you are expected to get from rolling ==6 3d6r1==.

#### More or Less Points
Of course you can give out more or less Points than 36 as a GM. I recommend changing the amount by multiples of 2 and keep in mind that even 4 more or less points already have a significant impact overall.

### Method 3: Quick Pick
This method is the best choice if you just want a decent selection of Scores to play with and get going right away. Just use the Scores below and distribute them among your scores. Again, they are in line with what you would be expected to get from using roll ==6 3d6r1==.
