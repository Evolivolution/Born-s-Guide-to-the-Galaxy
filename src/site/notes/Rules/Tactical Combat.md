# Tactical Combat
## Actions in Combat
### Attack of Opportunity
#Reaction, Trigger:
- Target leaves a space you threaten while performing a #Move action.
- Target performs a #Concentration action in a space you threaten.

Make a *Strike* with the #Threaten descriptor against the target. This *Strike* doesn't suffer from MAP.

### Crawl ðŸŸ£
#Move You move 1 space while *Prone*.

### Drop Prone ðŸŸ£
#Move You fall *Prone* in your space.

### Guarded Step ðŸŸ£
#Move A *Guarded Step* only allows you to move 1 space but unlike other #Move actions it does not provoke reactions. You can make a *Guarded Step* with any speed you have.

### Move ðŸŸ£
#Move A *Move* allows you to reposition yourself on the battlefield using one of your speeds.

### Ready (Varies)
#Concentration You might want to wait for a better opportunity to act. Choose an action you have access to. *Ready* costs a number of AP equal to the chosen actions AP cost +1. Specify a trigger, which can be as vague as 'this door opens' or 'an enemy attacks'. Until the start of your next turn you may perform the chosen action as a reaction. If you do so it gains the #Reaction descriptor, with the chosen trigger.

### Stand Up ðŸŸ£
#Move You stand up from *Prone*.

### Strike ðŸŸ£
#Attack A *Strike* is your basic attack. By base you can perform what is called an Unarmed Strike with various parts of your body. Weapons and an array of other features will allow you to perform other types of Strikes which function similar.
> [!TIP]- **Unarmed Strike ðŸŸ£** Athletics (Reach, AC) 1d3 B #Attack 
> **Critical Success:** You deal double damage.
> **Success:** You deal damage.
> **Failure:** You deal no damage.
> **Critical Failure:** You take the weapon damage.

### Withdraw ðŸŸ£ðŸŸ£+
#Move Like a *Guarded Step*, withdrawing doesn't provoke reactions buts it's a more drastic choice. You can only *Withdraw* if you haven't taken other actions this turn and it consumes all your AP (at least 2). You then *Move* a number of times equal to the number of AP spend this way -1. None of this movement provokes reactions. You keep your reaction but you may not perform #Offensive actions until your next turn.
