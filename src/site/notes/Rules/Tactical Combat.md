# Tactical Combat
## Actions in Combat
### Guarded Step ðŸŸ£
#Move A *Guarded Step* only allows you to move 1 space but unlike other #Move actions it does not provoke reactions. You can make a *Guarded Step* with any speed you have.

### Move ðŸŸ£
#Move A *Move* allows you to reposition yourself on the battlefield using one of your speeds. You may *Move* using multiple of your speeds. When doing so each speed is counted as a percentage of itself. For example; you have a land speed of 10 and a climb speed of 5. If you start out with using 6 spaces of your land speed that's 60%. You can then use the remaining 40% of your climb speed, or 2 spaces. Round down when a speed isn't divisible without remainder. For example; if you'd only used 5 spaces of your 10 land speed (50%) you still only get to go 2 spaces when using your climb speed (5 x 0.5 = 2.5 â‰ˆ 2).

### Strike ðŸŸ£
#Attack A *Strike* is your basic attack. By base you can perform what is called an Unarmed Strike with various parts of your body. Weapons and an array of other features will allow you to perform other types of Strikes which function similar.

### Withdraw ðŸŸ£ðŸŸ£+
#Move Like a *Guarded Step*, withdrawing doesn't provoke reactions buts it's a more drastic choice. You can only *Withdraw* if you haven't taken other actions this turn and it consumes all your AP (at least 2). You then *Move* a number of times equal to the number of AP spend this way -1. None of this movement provokes reactions. You keep your reaction but you may not use it to perform #Offensive actions.
