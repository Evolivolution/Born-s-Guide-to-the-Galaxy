# Tactical Combat
## Actions in Combat
### Strike ðŸŸ£
#Attack A Strike is your basic attack. By base you can perform what is called an Unarmed Strike with various parts of your body. Weapons and an array of other features will allow you to perform other types of Strikes which function similar. Strike entries look like this:
**Name | AP(usually 1)** | Skill used (Range, Target DC) Damage | Descriptors
â€ƒSuccess Range

Here is the Unarmed Strike as an example:
**Unarmed Strike ðŸŸ£** Athletics (Reach, AC) 1d3 B #Attack
 â€ƒ**Critical Success:** You deal double damage.
â€ƒ**Success:** Deal damage.
â€ƒ**Failure:** Deal no damage.
â€ƒ**Critical Failure:** Deal no damage.
