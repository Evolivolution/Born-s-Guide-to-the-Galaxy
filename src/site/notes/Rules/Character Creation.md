# Character Creation
## Step 1: [[Rules/Ancestries\|Ancestries]]
Your Ancestry reflects the dominant genetics of your character. Many of your key characteristics are determined by your Ancestry.
Choose an Ancestry from the list of available Ancestries.

## Step 2: [[Rules/Heritages\|Heritages]]
Where your Ancestry is all about the genetic lineage your Heritage more about the environment and culture you grew up in. Heritages might give you special features, access to bonus feats or modify your Ancestries stats.
You can choose Heritages from the list of your Ancestry's Heritages and the list of universal Heritages.

## Step 3: Class
Your Class is your main source of power. You choose a Class at level 1 from the list of available Classes.
Classes provide a selection of Skills, Proficiencies, Features, Feats, Saving Throw bonuses and much more. Over time you will gain XP and new levels which make you more powerful and give you access to more of your Class's abilities.

## Step 4: [[Rules/Ability Scores\|Ability Scores]]
Ability Scores are the main values your character depends on. They are the primary values used in the calculation for all the secondary stats you have like Armor and Skill Checks, Saving Throws, etc.
There are a bunch of different ways to determine Ability Scores depending on the desired power level and just what feels right. No matter which one you pick, you should end up with 6 values between 1 and 18, one each for Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma.
